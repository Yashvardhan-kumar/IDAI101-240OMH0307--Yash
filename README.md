Using Google Teachable Machine to Make an Animal Species Identifier

1.	Process of collecting and preparing data for training model—
Process of Collecting and Preparing Data for Training the Model
For a model to identify different animal species accurately, it’s essential to collect a diverse dataset of photos and videos representing the species in various environments, lighting conditions, angles, and poses. Images were sourced from open wildlife databases, field researchers, and camera trap footage. This diversity in data ensures the model can generalize well, improving accuracy and reliability in real-world settings, where animals may appear in different orientations and environmental contexts.
2.	Using Google’s Teachable Machine to Create the Model
Google's Teachable Machine simplifies the model-building process by allowing for quick dataset uploading, classification, and training without complex coding. By uploading images for each species category, the Teachable Machine processes and trains the model, which is then easily exportable for further customization or integration.
3.	Features and Functionalities Integrated into the Model
Key features include:
•	Real-Time Species Detection: The model is optimized for real-time predictions on incoming photo or video data streams.
•	Multi-Species Classification: It can identify various species accurately.
•	Environmental Adaptability: Thanks to diverse training data, the model performs well across different lighting and backgrounds.
Methods Used to Evaluate Model Performance
The model's performance was assessed using:
•	Accuracy and F1 Score: To measure the precision and recall balance across all species classes.
•	Confusion Matrix: To visualize which species were most commonly misclassified.
•	Real-World Testing: Field tests were conducted in varied environments to ensure the model performs effectively in practical conditions.
4.	Applications in Wildlife Monitoring and Real-World Use Cases
This model can be integrated into real-time wildlife monitoring systems. Camera traps or drones equipped with this model can automatically identify animal species in their natural habitats, enabling conservationists to monitor biodiversity, track animal movements, and prevent poaching. It also has applications in environmental studies and education, where instant species identification can aid field researchers and students in learning more about local wildlife populations.
